## Virology and Transmission

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a master of adaptation. As an enveloped, negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus with three genome segments (S, M, L), it employs a clever strategy: different segments separately code for the nucleoprotein, glycoproteins, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, allowing for rapid genetic shifts and survival in diverse environments, such as different hosts. The virus relies on Hyalomma ticks as both vectors and reservoirs. Humans typically become infected via tick bites, through crushing ticks, or contact with blood or tissues from infected animals or people. In healthcare, the threat is heightened by documented nosocomial outbreaks, underscoring CCHFV’s capability for person-to-person spread if precautions lapse. 

CCHFV is an enveloped negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the Orthonairovirus genus in the Nairoviridae family of the Bunyavirales order (Fig. 1a). In addition to CCHFV, the Nairoviridae family consists of arthropod-borne viruses such as Nairobi sheep disease virus, Dugbe virus and Hazara virus (HAZV), although these viruses seem to cause little-to-no disease in humans. As in other bunyaviruses, the tri-segmented viral genome is coated with the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and bound by the L protein (Fig. 1a). The viral proteins are encoded by three genomic segments (Fig. 1b), and relative to other members of the order that can cause human disease, CCHFV has a more complex

genomic organization (discussed below). On entry, these proteins produce positive-sense viral RNA using the genomic negative-sense viral RNA as a template to initiate viral protein production and replication (Fig. 1c). The viral glycoproteins Gn and Gc are found on the virion surface and are responsible for receptor binding and viral entry (Fig. 1a).

## Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus Biology

## Taxonomy and Classification

The genus to where CCHFV belongs to comprises several species, but CCHFV is the most significant human pathogen. The family Nairoviridae contains viruses primarily transmitted by ticks and is distinct from other bunyaviruses transmitted by mosquitoes or rodents.

**Order**: Bunyavirales

**Family**: Nairoviridae

**Genus**: Orthonairovirus

**Species**: Orthonairovirus haemorrhagiae (Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus)

## Virion Structure and Morphology

CCHFV virions are spherical to pleomorphic, enveloped particles with a diameter of 80–120 nm. The viral envelope is derived from the host cell membrane and is studded with two types of glycoprotein spikes: Gn and Gc.

CCHFV particles are generally spherical (80–120 nm in diameter) with a flexible envelope derived from the host cell. Embedded in this envelope are two types of spiky glycoproteins (Gn and Gc), which give the virus both its ability to latch onto new cells and to dodge immune defenses. The interior contains the tripartite genome as ribonucleoprotein complexes, expertly packaged for rapid replication

## Genome Organization

The CCHFV genome is neatly divided into three segments, each segment with a specific job.

**Small (S) Segment**: Encodes the nucleoprotein (N).

**Medium (M) Segment**: Encodes the glycoprotein precursor (GPC), which is processed into Gn, Gc, and several nonstructural proteins.

**Large (L) Segment**: Encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L protein).


| **Segment** | **Size (kb)** | **Key Protein(s)**     | **Role**                       |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| S           | ~1.7          | Nucleoprotein (N)      | RNA encapsidation, replication |
| M           | ~5.4          | Glycoproteins (Gn, Gc) | Host entry, immune evasion     |
| L           | ~12.1         | Polymerase (L)         | RNA synthesis                  |

Each segment is flanked by conserved noncoding regions, crucial for replication and genome packing. 

## Replication Cycle

CCHFV replicates entirely within the cytoplasm, following a rapid and efficient cycle:

1. **Entry**: Gn and Gc glycoproteins lock onto receptors on host cells, then the virus enters via clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
2. **Fusion & Release**: Acidic conditions in the cell trigger Gc-glycoproteins, merging viral and endosomal membranes and releasing viral complexes into the cytoplasm.
3. **Transcription/Translation**: The L polymerase “steals” caps from host mRNA (cap-snatching) for viral mRNA synthesis; proteins are made on host ribosomes.
4. **Genome Replication**: Complementary full-length RNA is created to serve as templates for more genomic RNA.
5. **Assembly and Release:** Viral proteins and genomes are assembled at the Golgi or plasma membrane; new virus particles exit the cell by budding, armed for further infection.

## Genetic Diversity and Evolution

CCHFV stands out as one of the most variable tick-borne viruses—strains can differ by up to 20% in their genetic code. This diversity results from:

* **The virus's segmented genome**, promoting exchanges and rearrangements during co-infection by different strains within a host.
* A **naturallly high mutation rate** due to lack of proofreading during replication.
* The evolution in a **wide geographic range** with circulation in many tick and animal hosts.

Phylogenetic studies show major lineages in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. This diversity of the virus contributes to the emergence of novel strains with unpredictedable virulence and epidemiology. 

## Ecology, Hosts, and Transmission Dynamics

## Tick Vectors

Hyalomma ticks are both the long-term home and the main vector for CCHFV. They can carry the virus throughout their multi-stage life cycle—larva, nymph, adult—and even transmit it to their offspring. Once infected, ticks remain carriers for life and transmit the virus to animals and sometimes humans.

## Vertebrate Hosts

A wide array of animals —cattle, sheep, goats, camels, horses, hares, hedgehogs, rodents— can host CCHFV. Most animals show no symptoms but get short-lived viremia, providing a bridge for ticks to pick up and spread the virus. Some ground-feeding birds may carry infected ticks but generally do not get sick.

## Human Infection

Humans are accidental hosts, typically becoming infected by:

* **Tick bites**, the primary pathway.
* **Contact with blood/tissues**. Farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers are at heightened risk when handling livestock, particularly during slaughter or birthing, as the virus can spread through small cuts or abrasions.
* **Nosocomial (hospital-acquired) or household transmission**, via blood or body fluids.
* **Laboratory exposure**. Rare, but laboratory workers can become infected while handling patient samples or cultures if strict biosafety practices are not observed.

Humans, however, generally do not develop high enough viremia to infect new ticks, so human-to-tick transmission is usually insignificant in the spread of the virus.

## Geographic Distribution

The virus is endemic in over 30 countries spanning Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Asia. Its geographic footprint closely shadows the range of its preferred tick hosts, particularly *Hyalomma* ticks. This distribution is not random; instead, it is shaped by environmental and human-made factors:

* **Ecological factors**: Regions with climates that favor dense vegetation and sustain livestock provide ideal habitats for ticks, increasing the risk of CCHFV transmission.
* **Animal trade and migration**: The movement of animals across borders, whether for trade or seasonal migration, can carry infected ticks into new regions.
* **Human activities**: Agricultural practices, animal husbandry, and even simple travel to endemic areas enhance opportunities for people and animals to encounter infected ticks.

Countries such as Turkey, Iran, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, South Africa, and those in the Balkans have reported important outbreaks. These occurrences tend to spike seasonally, usually during periods when tick activity reaches its peak, often coinciding with warmer weather or heightened agricultural activity .
