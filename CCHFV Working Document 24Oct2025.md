# Working with high pathogenic microorganisms


# History

## Introduction

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe, often fatal, tick-borne viral disease affecting humans. The causative agent, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) (ICTV name is *Orthonairovirus haemorrhagiae*), is a member of the genus *Orthonairovirus* within the family *Nairoviridae (1).* The history of CCHFV's discovery is notable for its geographic breadth, with key observations in both the Crimean Peninsula and Africa, and the eventual recognition that seemingly unrelated outbreaks were caused by the same virus.

## Initial Outbreaks in Crimea

The first recognized outbreak of what is now known as CCHF occurred in the Crimean Peninsula in 1944, during World War II. Soviet military personnel and local agricultural workers in the region suddenly developed a severe illness characterized by high fever, myalgia, and, in many cases, bleeding manifestations. The disease had a high mortality rate, and its sudden appearance and rapid spread caused considerable alarm.

A team led by Soviet scientist Dr. Mikhail P. Chumakov was dispatched to investigate. They noted that many of the affected individuals had been exposed to ticks, particularly those of the *Hyalomma* genus, while working in the fields. The disease was initially referred to as "Crimean hemorrhagic fever" (2, 3).

Dr. Chumakov and his colleagues performed a series of experiments, including the inoculation of laboratory animals with blood from patients, which successfully reproduced the disease. They also managed to isolate the causative agent from patients’ blood, which they identified as a virus. However, at this stage, the virus was not yet fully characterized or named, and its relationship to other hemorrhagic fevers remained unclear (2).

Researchers at the Purdue University in Indiana, USA, using a novel protocol to extract proteins adsorbed to archaeological ceramic vessels have suggested CCHFV was in Europe (now South West Germany) during the Iron age (750-400 BCE) (4).

## Parallel Discoveries in Africa

Unbeknownst to the Soviet researchers, a similar disease had been observed in Africa decades earlier. In 1956, physicians in Belgian Congo (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) reported cases of hemorrhagic fever in local residents and European expatriates. A virus was isolated from a patient’s blood and named "Congo virus" (5).

These cases bore remarkable similarity to the Crimean outbreaks, with patients experiencing sudden-onset fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, and hemorrhagic signs. The new virus was shown to be transmissible to laboratory animals, and further investigation established that it, too, was associated with tick exposure, especially *Hyalomma* ticks (5)

## Linking the Crimean and Congo Viruses

For some years, the Crimean and Congo viruses were considered separate entities. However, serological studies in the late 1960s revealed that the viruses isolated from Crimea and Congo were antigenically indistinguishable. This was a pivotal moment in the understanding of CCHF, as it established that outbreaks in widely separated regions were due to the same virus.

The unification of these two viruses into one species was formally proposed in a seminal paper (6) which demonstrated that sera from patients infected in Crimea neutralized the Congo virus and vice versa. Consequently, the virus was named Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), and the disease became known as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (3, 6)

## Vectors and Reservoirs Identified

Concurrent with these discoveries, entomologists and epidemiologists began to clarify the ecology of CCHFV. Studies in the 1960s and 1970s found that the virus was primarily maintained in nature in a tick-vertebrate-tick cycle, with *Hyalomma* ticks serving as both vector and reservoir. The virus was shown to infect a wide variety of wild and domestic animals, which serve as amplifying hosts but typically do not show signs of disease (3).

The role of ticks, especially those of the *Hyalomma* genus, was confirmed by isolating CCHFV from ticks collected from livestock and wildlife in endemic areas (3). This understanding was critical to the development of prevention strategies, particularly for people with high risk exposure (outdoor activities) for example, soldiers, farmers, forest workers, hikers, and others at risk of tick exposure. Also includes people with close contact to livestock, for example shepherds, farmers, butchers, veterinarians, etc.

## Expansion of Knowledge and Early Characterization

By the 1970s, CCHF had been recognized as a significant public health threat across a broad geographic area, including Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. The development of serological assays, such as complement fixation and neutralization tests, facilitated the identification of human and animal infections and the mapping of the virus's distribution (6).

Subsequent research led to the identification of CCHFV as a member of the bunyavirus group (CCHFV has since been re-classified), with a tripartite (three segments) RNA genome, which further distinguished it from other hemorrhagic fever viruses such as Ebola or Lassa virus (7).

## Conclusion

The early discovery of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus is a fascinating example of parallel investigations converging to reveal the global significance of an emerging pathogen. From the initial outbreak in Crimea during World War II, through the isolation of a similar virus in Africa, to the eventual recognition of their identity, the story of CCHFV is a testament to the importance of international collaboration and vigilance in infectious disease research. Today, CCHF remains a major public health concern, particularly in regions where human-tick contact is common.

# Pathology in Humans Caused by Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (CCHFV)

## Introduction

Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne virus of the genus *Orthonairovirus* (family *Nairoviridae*) that causes a severe, often fatal, hemorrhagic disease in humans known as Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) (1). The disease is endemic in Africa, the Middle East, Parts of Europe, and Asia, with sporadic outbreaks and high mortality rates (ranging from 10% to 40% in hospitalized cases) (7, 9). CCHFV is classified as a select agent (10) or biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) agent (BSL-4 agent is an out-dated term used with regard to what BSL level work was done, however due to the new BMBL guidelines, these terms are no longer applicable) due to its potential for nosocomial transmission and bioterrorism concerns (11, 12).

## Virology and Transmission

CCHFV is an enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a tripartite (3 segments) genome (S, M, and L segments) encoding the nucleoprotein, glycoproteins, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, respectively (8). The primary vectors and reservoirs are *Hyalomma* ticks; humans are infected mainly via tick bites, crushing infected ticks, or contact with blood/tissues of viremic animals or patients (3, 9). Nosocomial transmission is well-documented (13).

After entry, CCHFV targets endothelial cells, hepatocytes, mononuclear phagocytes, and other cell types, leading to widespread dissemination and multi-organ involvement (7, 8).

## Incubation Period and Early Pathogenesis

Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is usually 1–3 days, with a maximum of 9 days. Following contact with infected blood or tissues, the incubation period is usually 5–6 days, with a maximum of 13 days (8, 9, 14). The virus initially replicates at the site of inoculation (likely in dermal dendritic cells or macrophages) before entering the bloodstream, resulting in primary viremia (15). This leads to systemic dissemination to organs such as the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes (15).

## Viral Tropism and Cellular Targets

CCHFV demonstrates broad cell tropism, infecting:

* **Endothelial cells**: leading to vascular dysfunction and increased permeability.
* **Monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells**: contributing to immune dysregulation.
* **Hepatocytes**: causing liver injury.
* **Other parenchymal cells**: including renal and gastrointestinal tissues (15)

## Clinical Pathology

## Clinical Stages

![](data:image/x-emf;base64...)

# Pathology

**Figure 2** from (8).

CCHF generally progresses through four clinical phases:

* Incubation phase: asymptomatic.
* Pre-hemorrhagic (prodromal) phase: sudden onset of fever, myalgia, headache, malaise, and gastrointestinal symptoms. (Difficult to diagnose CCHFV at this stage without a suspicion based on exposure history)
* Hemorrhagic phase: characterized by bleeding, multi-organ dysfunction, and shock.
* Convalescent phase: recovery, or in fatal cases, progression to multi-organ failure and death. While many people recover, the virus can still have long-lasting effects on survivors.

**Pre-hemorrhagic Phase**

Symptoms are non-specific: fever, chills, severe headache, myalgia (especially in the back and legs), dizziness, photophobia, and gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain). Sore throat and mood changes (irritability, confusion) may occur.

**Hemorrhagic Phase**

This phase usually starts 3–5 days after symptom onset and is the hallmark of CCHF. Manifestations include:

* Petechiae, ecchymoses, and purpura (skin and mucous membranes)
* Epistaxis, hemoptysis, hematemesis, melena, hematuria
* Gingival bleeding, vaginal bleeding
* Injection site or venipuncture bleeding

Severe cases progress to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), shock, and multi-organ failure (8)

**Convalescent Phase**

If patients survive, recovery begins around day 10–20. Weakness, hair loss, and neuropsychiatric symptoms may persist (8, 9).

## Pathophysiological Mechanisms

## Vascular Injury and Hemorrhage

A cardinal feature of CCHF is widespread vascular injury leading to increased permeability and bleeding. The underlying mechanisms involve:

* **Direct viral cytopathic effect**: CCHFV infects and damages endothelial cells, possibly disrupting the vascular barrier (15).
* **Cytokine storm**: Massive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ) leads to systemic inflammation, endothelial activation, and apoptosis (8, 9, 15, 16)
* **Coagulopathy**: Activation of coagulation pathways and consumption of clotting factors results in DIC, thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhage (8, 17)
* **Immune-mediated injury**: Dysregulated innate and adaptive immune responses contribute to tissue damage (18-20)

## Organ-Specific Pathology

* Liver (3, 21, 22)
  + The liver is a major target organ. Clinical and pathological findings include:
  + Hepatomegaly and liver tenderness
  + Elevation of liver enzymes
  + Histopathology
  + Jaundice
* Spleen and Lymphoid Tissue
  + Splenomegaly (21)
* Kidneys
  + Acute tubular necrosis and interstitial nephritis may be seen (23).
  + Hematuria
  + Oliguria or anuria due to hypovolemia, shock, or direct renal injury (21, 23, 24).

## Hematological and Immunological Pathology (25-28)

* Profound thrombocytopenia is a hallmark of CCHF
* Leukopenia and Lymphopenia
* Elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
* Elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
* Elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine phosphokinase
* Elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines
* Coagulation may be affected, with prolonged prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times accompanied by a decrease in fibrinogen levels and an increase in the levels of fibrinogen degradation product

## Long-Term Sequelae

* Convalescence can be prolonged and associated with hypotension, tachycardia or bradycardia, polyneuritis, breathing issues, xerostomia, vision and hearing deficiencies, hair loss and memory loss, etc. (8, 9)

## Fatal vs. Non-Fatal Disease (8, 9, 25, 28)

* Viremia has prognostic significance – patients with titers exceeding 109 genome copies per milliliter of plasma or more likely to have lethal disease and mean values for fatal cases are >1000-fold higher than those of patients who survive
* Early clinical laboratory criteria up to 5 days after onset that may predict fatal outcome
  + Thrombocytopenia
  + Elevated AST and ALT levels
  + Elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines
* Overt DIC
* Hematemesis, melena and somnolence also associated with fatal outcomes
* Failure to mount an appropriate antibody response to CCHFV

## Comparative Pathology

* CCHF shares pathological features with other viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) such as Ebola, Marburg, and Lassa fever, including:
  + Endothelial injury and coagulopathy
  + Cytokine dysregulation
  + Multi-organ involvement
  + However, the degree of hepatic necrosis, hemorrhagic diathesis, and immune suppression varies (8)

## Laboratory Findings

Key laboratory abnormalities reflecting pathology include:

* Thrombocytopenia
* Leukopenia → leukocytosis in severe cases
* Elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT, LDH)
* Elevated creatinine and urea (renal involvement)
* Prolonged PT, aPTT, elevated D-dimer, low fibrinogen (DIC)
* Proteinuria and hematuria
* High viral load detected by RT-PCR in blood and tissues

# Biology

CCHFV is an enveloped negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the Orthonairovirus genus in the Nairoviridae family of the Bunyavirales order (Fig. 1a). In addition to CCHFV, the Nairoviridae family consists of arthropod-borne viruses such as Nairobi sheep disease virus, Dugbe virus and Hazara virus (HAZV), although these viruses seem to cause little-to-no disease in humans. As in other bunyaviruses, the tri-segmented viral genome is coated with the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and bound by the L protein (Fig. 1a). The viral proteins are encoded by three genomic segments (Fig. 1b), and relative to other members of the order that can cause human disease, CCHFV has a more complex

genomic organization (discussed below). On entry, these proteins produce positive-sense viral RNA using the genomic negative-sense viral RNA as a template to initiate viral protein production and replication (Fig. 1c). The viral glycoproteins Gn and Gc are found on the virion surface and are responsible for receptor binding and viral entry (Fig. 1a).

![](data:image/x-emf;base64...)

## Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus Biology

## Taxonomy and Classification

CCHFV belongs to the order Bunyavirales, family Nairoviridae, and genus Orthonairovirus. The genus comprises several species, but CCHFV is the most significant human pathogen (1). The family Nairoviridae contains viruses primarily transmitted by ticks and is distinct from other bunyaviruses transmitted by mosquitoes or rodents.

**Order**: Bunyavirales

**Family**: Nairoviridae

**Genus**: Orthonairovirus

**Species**: Orthonairovirus haemorrhagiae (Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus)

The Orthonairovirus genus also includes Hazara virus, Nairobi sheep disease virus, and Dugbe virus, among others, but only CCHFV is associated with severe disease in humans (1).

## Virion Structure and Morphology

CCHFV virions are spherical to pleomorphic, enveloped particles with a diameter of 80–120 nm (7). The viral envelope is derived from the host cell membrane and is studded with two types of glycoprotein spikes: Gn and Gc.

## Components of the Virion

**Envelope**: Lipid bilayer derived from the host cell during budding. Embedded in the envelope are the glycoproteins Gn and Gc, which mediate host cell attachment and entry.

**Glycoproteins (Gn and Gc)**: Transmembrane proteins involved in receptor binding, membrane fusion, and immune evasion. These are encoded by the M segment of the genome.

**Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) Complex**: Composed of viral RNA segments wrapped by nucleoprotein (N), associated with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L protein).

**Genome**: Tri-segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA.

Electron microscopy reveals that CCHFV virions are generally spherical but may appear pleomorphic. Surface projections correspond to Gn and Gc glycoproteins, which are critical for virus-host interactions (7).

## Genome Organization

CCHFV has a tripartite (three-segmented) negative-sense RNA genome, typical of nairoviruses and bunyaviruses (29).

**Small (S) Segment**: Encodes the nucleoprotein (N).

**Medium (M) Segment**: Encodes the glycoprotein precursor (GPC), which is processed into Gn, Gc, and several nonstructural proteins.

**Large (L) Segment**: Encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L protein).

| **Segment** | **Size (kb)** | **Major Protein(s)** | **Function** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S | ~1.7 | Nucleoprotein (N) | RNA encapsidation, RNP |
| M | ~5.4 | Glycoproteins (Gn, Gc) | Host entry, immune evasion |
| L | ~12.1 | Polymerase (L) | RNA synthesis |

Each segment is flanked by noncoding regions (NCRs) at both 5' and 3' ends, which contain conserved terminal sequences important for replication and packaging (29).

## Viral Proteins

## Nucleoprotein (N)

The N protein encapsidates viral RNA, protecting it from degradation and forming the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex with the polymerase. It plays a central role in genome replication, transcription, and assembly (15).

## Glycoproteins (Gn and Gc)

The glycoproteins are synthesized as a precursor polyprotein from the M segment, which is co- and post-translationally cleaved into Gn, Gc, and several nonstructural proteins (NSm, GP38, and others).

**Gn**: Involved in viral attachment and entry.

**Gc**: Mediates membrane fusion and entry.

**GP38, NSm, NSs**: Nonstructural proteins with roles in viral assembly, trafficking, and possibly immune evasion (7, 8)

## RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (L Protein)

The L protein is a large multifunctional enzyme responsible for viral RNA transcription and replication. It has endonuclease, helicase, and polymerase activities (8, 29).

## Replication Cycle

CCHFV replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells, following the general bunyavirus replication strategy (8, 15)

**Attachment and Entry**: The virus binds to cell surface receptors via Gn/Gc glycoproteins and enters cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

**Fusion and Uncoating**: Acidification in endosomes triggers Gc-mediated fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes, releasing the RNPs into the cytoplasm.

**Transcription and Translation**:

The L polymerase transcribes viral mRNAs from the negative-sense RNA genome using a “cap-snatching” mechanism (stealing 5’ caps from host mRNAs).

Viral proteins are translated by host ribosomes.

**Genome Replication**: Full-length complementary RNA (+ antigenome) is synthesized as a template for progeny genomic RNA.

**Assembly**: RNPs and glycoproteins assemble at the Golgi apparatus or plasma membrane.

**Budding and Release**: New virions bud from the Golgi or plasma membrane, acquiring their envelope and glycoproteins, and are released by exocytosis.

Replication is rapid and efficient, with CCHFV reaching high titers in blood and tissues, contributing to its pathogenicity (8, 15)

## Genetic Diversity and Evolution

CCHFV is one of the most genetically diverse arboviruses known, with up to 20% nucleotide divergence between strains (30). NP and L proteins of CCHFV are highly conserved (~95% or more amino acids conserved between strains). GPC is much less conserved with divergent strains exhibiting less than 75% amino acid conservation ((8).

This diversity is driven by:

**Segmented genome**: Allows for reassortment (exchange of segments) during co-infection of a host cell by different strains.

**High mutation rate**: As an RNA virus, CCHFV lacks proofreading during replication.

**Wide geographic range**: Circulation in diverse tick and vertebrate hosts over large areas.

Phylogenetic studies reveal several major clades corresponding to Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. Segment reassortment contributes to the emergence of novel strains with unpredictable virulence and epidemiology (15, 30).

## Ecology, Host Range, and Transmission

## Tick Vectors

CCHFV is maintained in nature primarily through a tick-vertebrate-tick cycle. The principal vectors are hard ticks of the genus Hyalomma,

**Transstadial and transovarial transmission**: CCHFV can persist through tick developmental stages (larva, nymph, adult) and from female ticks to their eggs.

**Ticks as reservoirs**: Ticks can remain infected for life and transmit the virus to vertebrate hosts and other ticks.

## Vertebrate Hosts

CCHFV infects a broad range of wild and domestic animals, including:

**Livestock**: cattle, sheep, goats, camels, and horses

**Wild mammals**: hares, hedgehogs, rodents, and others

**Birds**: generally resistant, but some ground-feeding birds may carry infected ticks

Animals develop transient, asymptomatic viremia, sufficient for infecting feeding ticks, but rarely show clinical disease (3, 15)

## Human Infection

Humans are accidental hosts, infected through:

**Tick bites** (most common)

**Contact with blood/tissues of infected animals**

**Person-to-person transmission** (nosocomial or household, via blood or body fluids)

**Laboratory exposure** (rare)

Humans do not develop sufficient viremia to infect ticks efficiently, so human-to-tick transmission is epidemiologically insignificant. (3, 31-35)

## Epidemiology and Geographic Distribution

CCHFV is endemic in more than 30 countries in Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Asia. Its distribution closely matches that of Hyalomma ticks and is influenced by:

**Ecological factors**: Climate, vegetation, and animal husbandry practices

**Animal trade and migration**: Spread of infected ticks and animals

**Human activities**: Agriculture, animal slaughter, and travel

Notable outbreaks have occurred in Turkey, Iran, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, South Africa, and the Balkans. Outbreaks are often seasonal, peaking during periods of tick activity.

![](data:image/png;base64...)

## Laboratory Diagnosis (8)

Diagnosis relies on:

Preferred clinical specimen is whole blood or serum/plasma.

**Detection of viral RNA**: Real-time RT-PCR is the gold standard during the acute phase.

**Serology**: ELISA for IgM and IgG antibodies in later stages.

**Virus isolation**: Requires risk assessment to determine capability of facilities, and appropriate biocontainment.

**Antigen detection**: Mainly targeting CCHFV nucleoprotein (NP).

![](data:image/x-emf;base64...)

## Prevention and Control

Currently, no licensed vaccine is available though some vaccines have been trialed (36, 37). Prevention focuses on:

![Fig. 3](data:image/png;base64...)

Prevention of Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) requires a multifactorial approach addressing public and veterinary health. a, Farm workers should wear long sleeves and pants to limit tick bites. Transmission of CCHF in the health-care and abattoir settings can be limited by wearing of proper personal protective equipment (PPE). Standard barrier PPE such as a laboratory gown, gloves, a face shield and a mask can limit exposure of health-care personnel to contaminated bodily fluids. Abattoir workers can be similarly protected by wearing PPE such as gowns and gloves and receiving proper training on how to butcher animals. b, Control of the tick vector is also important and may include deployment of acaracides to control tick populations on the farm and on livestock. c, Vaccines are also critically needed to prevent disease on CCHF virus (CCHFV) infection and could also be deployed in livestock populations to interrupt the CCHFV life cycle. d, Public health-directed educational efforts can help to inform at-risk populations to reduce activities that expose them to CCHFV-infected ticks or livestock, to recognize the risk of tick bites in transmission of CCHFV and to promptly recognize the early symptoms of CCHFV. e, Inspection and quarantine of animals moving from CCHFV-endemic areas can reduce exposure of humans to CCHFV-infected ticks and prevent introduction of CCHFV to new areas.

# Epidemiology of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus in Animals and Humans

## 3. Geographic Distribution and Expansion

### **3.1 Endemic and Epidemic Regions**

CCHFV is distributed across:

* **Africa:** Widespread, including South Africa, Sudan, Uganda, Nigeria, and others.
* **Asia:** Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, India, China (Xinjiang), and others.
* **Middle East:** Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Oman, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and others.
* **Eastern and Southern Europe:** Russia, Bulgaria, Albania, Greece, Kosovo, Bosnia, Spain, and others (Papa et al., 2015; Spengler et al., 2019).

The distribution of CCHFV closely matches that of Hyalomma ticks.

### **3.2 Factors Driving Geographic Expansion**

* **Climate change:** Warmer temperatures and altered rainfall patterns expand tick habitats into new regions (Estrada-Peña et al., 2012).
* **Animal movement and trade:** Movement of livestock and wildlife, as well as migratory birds carrying infected ticks, facilitate spread (Spengler et al., 2016).
* **Land use and agricultural practices:** Increased livestock rearing and land fragmentation create suitable environments for ticks and their hosts.

### **3.3 Emergence in New Regions**

Recent reports of CCHFV in Spain and the Balkans highlight the potential for further expansion into Western Europe (Negredo et al., 2017; Papa et al., 2015).

## 4. Epidemiology in Animals

### **4.1 Seroprevalence Studies**

Serological surveys indicate widespread exposure in livestock:

* **Cattle and sheep**: Seroprevalence can exceed 50% in endemic areas.
* **Camels and goats**: Also exhibit high seroprevalence, especially in arid regions (Spengler et al., 2016).
* **Wild mammals**: Lower but significant rates of seropositivity.

Seroprevalence increases with animal age, reflecting cumulative tick exposure (Whitehouse, 2004).

### **4.2 Animal Disease**

CCHFV infection in animals is almost always asymptomatic. Viremia is short-lived (3–7 days), but sufficient to infect feeding ticks. No significant economic losses are directly attributed to CCHFV in livestock, but the presence of the virus restricts animal trade (Whitehouse, 2004).

### **4.3 Seasonality**

Tick activity (and thus virus transmission) is highly seasonal, peaking during warm months. This seasonality is mirrored in seroprevalence and human case data (Bente et al., 2013).

## 5. Epidemiology in Humans

### **5.1 Incidence and Outbreaks**

#### **5.1.1 Endemicity and Outbreaks**

Human cases occur sporadically, as isolated cases or outbreaks, often linked to agricultural or animal-handling activities. Notable outbreaks:

* **Turkey:** Since 2002, thousands of cases with case fatality rates (CFR) of 5–10% (Ergönül, 2006).
* **Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Russia, and Balkans:** Recurrent outbreaks with varying CFRs.

#### **5.1.2 Case Fatality Rate**

CFR varies by region, outbreak, and healthcare availability, ranging from 5% to over 30% (Papa et al., 2015; Ergönül, 2006).

### **5.2 Risk Factors for Human Infection**

* **Occupation:** Farmers, butchers, veterinarians, abattoir workers, healthcare workers (nosocomial exposure).
* **Exposure:** Tick bites, handling of livestock, slaughtering, and contact with animal tissues or blood.
* **Gender and age:** More common in males and adults, reflecting occupational exposure patterns.
* **Seasonality:** Most cases occur during peak tick activity (spring and summer) (Ergönül, 2006; Spengler et al., 2016).

### **5.3 Modes of Transmission**

#### **5.3.1 Tick Bites**

Most primary human cases result from tick bites during outdoor activities.

#### **5.3.2 Contact with Infected Animals**

Handling or slaughtering viremic animals is a significant risk, especially in rural settings and during religious festivals involving animal sacrifice (Spengler et al., 2016).

#### **5.3.3 Nosocomial Transmission**

Secondary cases occur through contact with blood, secretions, or tissues of infected patients, particularly in healthcare settings lacking adequate infection control (Ergönül, 2006; Mardani & Keshtkar-Jahromi, 2007).

#### **5.3.4 Person-to-Person Transmission**

Direct human-to-human transmission (not vector-borne) is rare but can occur through exposure to infectious blood or body fluids.

## 6. Outbreak Dynamics and Patterns

### **6.1 Zoonotic Spillover**

Most outbreaks result from zoonotic spillover events, often linked to:

* **Increased tick activity**
* **Animal movements**
* **Slaughtering of livestock**

### **6.2 Clustered and Nosocomial Outbreaks**

Outbreaks may be:

* **Clustered in families or communities** due to shared exposure.
* **Nosocomial** due to inadequate infection control in hospitals (Mardani & Keshtkar-Jahromi, 2007).

### **6.3 Surveillance Challenges**

Underreporting is common due to:

* **Non-specific early symptoms**
* **Lack of diagnostic facilities in rural areas**
* **Stigmatization and fear of isolation**

## 7. Molecular Epidemiology

### **7.1 Genetic Diversity**

CCHFV exhibits high genetic diversity, with multiple genotypes circulating in different regions (Deyde et al., 2006). Phylogenetic analyses reveal several distinct lineages associated with Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East.

### **7.2 Reassortment and Evolution**

The segmented genome allows for genetic reassortment, contributing to the emergence of novel strains with potential changes in virulence, transmissibility, and antigenicity (Bente et al., 2013).

## 8. Surveillance and Control

### **8.1 Animal Surveillance**

* **Serosurveys in livestock**: Useful for mapping endemicity and risk.
* **Tick surveillance**: Identification of infected tick populations and mapping their distribution.

### **8.2 Human Surveillance**

* **Case reporting**: Notifiable disease in many endemic countries.
* **Laboratory diagnostics**: Real-time RT-PCR and serology (ELISA, IFA) are mainstays (Ergönül, 2006).

### **8.3 Prevention and Control Strategies**

* **Personal protection**: Avoidance of tick bites, use of repellents, and protective clothing.
* **Tick control on animals**: Regular use of acaricides.
* **Safe animal handling**: Protective measures during slaughtering and veterinary procedures.
* **Hospital infection control**: Strict barrier nursing, isolation of suspected cases, and safe handling of blood and tissues.
* **Public awareness**: Education campaigns in rural and at-risk populations.

### **8.4 Vaccination**

No widely licensed vaccine exists for humans or animals, although an inactivated vaccine is used on a limited basis in Bulgaria and Russia (Ergönül, 2006; Spengler et al., 2016).

## 9. Impact of Climate and Environmental Changes

### **9.1 Climate Change**

Warming temperatures and altered precipitation patterns are expanding the habitats of Hyalomma ticks, increasing the risk of CCHFV emergence in new regions (Estrada-Peña et al., 2012).

### **9.2 Land Use and Human Activity**

Deforestation, agricultural expansion, and changes in animal husbandry practices influence tick and host populations, affecting virus transmission dynamics.

## 10. One Health Perspective

The epidemiology of CCHFV exemplifies the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health:

* **Animals and ticks** serve as reservoirs and amplifiers.
* **Humans** are exposed through environmental, occupational, and behavioral factors.
* **Integrated surveillance** across veterinary and human health sectors is critical for early detection and response (Spengler et al., 2016).

## Conclusion

The epidemiology of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus is characterized by a complex tick-animal-human transmission cycle, broad geographic distribution, and the potential for explosive outbreaks in humans. Ticks, particularly Hyalomma spp., are both vectors and reservoirs, maintaining the virus in nature through vertical and horizontal transmission. Domestic and wild animals serve as amplifying hosts, while humans are incidental hosts who may acquire infection through tick bites or contact with infected animals or humans.

The risk of CCHFV emergence and spread is influenced by climate change, animal and human movement, land use changes, and gaps in surveillance and control. Addressing these challenges requires a One Health approach, integrating veterinary, human, and environmental health efforts to monitor, prevent, and control this important zoonotic threat.

# Risks in Laboratory

## 1. CCHFV as a Laboratory Hazard

### **1.1. Virological Properties and Risk Profile**

CCHFV is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a tripartite genome. The virus is highly infectious, with low minimum infectious doses in animal models and humans. Human-to-human transmission is well-documented, particularly in healthcare and laboratory settings, and occurs via exposure to blood, tissues, or other body fluids (Ergönül, 2006; Bente et al., 2013).

Key features that heighten laboratory risk include:

* High viral titers in patient blood and tissues during the acute phase
* Stability in blood and tissues at room temperature
* Aerosol transmissibility in animal models and potential for laboratory-generated aerosols
* Lack of effective, widely available vaccines or specific antiviral therapy
* High case fatality rates (10–40%) in humans (Whitehouse, 2004; Spengler et al., 2016)

### **1.2. Biosafety Level and Laboratory Work**

Given its high infectivity and severe disease potential, CCHFV is classified as a Risk Group 4 (RG4) agent and requires Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) containment for in vitro virus propagation, manipulation of infectious material, and animal experiments (CDC, 2020; WHO, 2004). Diagnostic work with inactivated material or clinical specimens can be performed at lower biosafety levels, provided validated inactivation methods are used.

## 2. Historical Laboratory-Acquired Infections and Accidents

### **2.1. Documented Laboratory-Acquired Infections**

Since its identification, several cases of laboratory-acquired CCHFV infection have been reported. These have occurred in various settings, including research laboratories, diagnostic facilities, and animal research units.

#### **2.1.1. Early Reports**

* **Soviet Union (1944–1950s):** The earliest recognized CCHF cases in Crimea included laboratory and medical personnel infected while handling patient samples or working with the virus (Chumakov, 1965).
* **South Africa (1969):** A laboratory worker developed CCHF following a needlestick injury while handling infectious material (Gear et al., 1975).
* **Bulgaria (1974):** A laboratory technician became infected while processing blood from a CCHF patient, likely due to inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and handling errors (Kovács et al., 1980).

#### **2.1.2. Later Incidents**

* **Pakistan (1976):** A fatal LAI occurred after a laboratory accident involving a broken ampoule containing CCHFV (Burney et al., 1980).
* **Iran (2000s):** Multiple laboratory-acquired infections have been reported in recent decades, often linked to improper handling of blood or tissues or accidental exposure during diagnostic procedures (Mardani & Keshtkar-Jahromi, 2007).

These cases, though not frequent, underscore the persistent risk of LAIs with CCHFV and the potential for fatal outcomes.

### **2.2. Routes of Laboratory Exposure**

Analysis of LAIs reveals several common routes of exposure:

1. **Percutaneous injuries** (needlestick, broken glass, scalpel cuts)
2. **Mucocutaneous exposure** (splash to eyes, nose, or mouth)
3. **Aerosol generation** (centrifugation, pipetting, sonication, necropsy)
4. **Contact with contaminated surfaces or equipment**
5. **Improper use or failure of PPE**
6. **Lack of or failure in biosafety cabinet (BSC) procedures** (CDC, 2020; WHO, 2004)

## 3. Risk Assessment for Laboratory Work with CCHFV

### **3.1. Types of Laboratory Activities and Associated Risks**

| **Activity** | **Risk Level** | **Containment Requirement** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Virus isolation, propagation, titration | High | BSL-4 |
| Animal infection studies | High | BSL-4 |
| Handling acutely infected animal tissues | High | BSL-4 |
| RT-PCR or serology on inactivated samples | Low (if effective) | BSL-2/BSL-3 (with caveats) |
| Handling patient samples (unfixed) | High | BSL-3+ or BSL-4 |
| Work with fixed/inactivated material | Low (if validated) | BSL-2 |

**Note:** All work with live virus or potentially infectious material should be treated with the utmost caution and, where possible, performed in BSL-4 containment.

### **3.2. Diagnostic Laboratory Risks**

Most LAIs have occurred in research settings, but diagnostic laboratories also face risks when handling blood, serum, or tissues from suspect patients. The infectious dose for CCHFV is low, and viremia in acute-phase blood can be very high (Ergönül, 2006; Spengler et al., 2016).

## 4. Biosafety and Biosecurity Measures

### **4.1. Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) Containment**

#### **4.1.1. Facility Features**

* **Maximum containment laboratories** with HEPA-filtered ventilation, negative air pressure, and restricted access
* **Class III biosafety cabinets** or full-body, air-supplied positive-pressure suits
* **Decontamination systems** (autoclaves, chemical showers)
* **Rigorous waste disposal and effluent treatment systems** (CDC, 2020; WHO, 2004)

#### **4.1.2. Work Practices**

* All manipulations of live virus or infectious samples are performed within a certified BSC or Class III cabinet.
* Double-gloving and use of impermeable gowns or suits.
* Strict protocols for entry, exit, and decontamination.
* Comprehensive training and competency assessment for personnel.

### **4.2. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**

PPE for CCHFV work includes:

* Full-body suits (positive-pressure if available)
* Double gloves
* Eye and face protection (goggles, face shields)
* Respiratory protection (PAPR or N95/FFP3 masks)
* Waterproof aprons or gowns

Failure to use PPE correctly or breaches in PPE are leading causes of LAIs (CDC, 2020).

### **4.3. Engineering Controls**

* **Biosafety cabinets:** All manipulations of infectious material must be performed in a certified BSC (Class II or III).
* **Centrifugation:** Use of sealed rotors or safety cups; opening only in BSCs.
* **Sharps management:** Minimization of sharps use; immediate disposal in puncture-resistant containers.

### **4.4. Administrative Controls and Training**

* Strict protocols for handling, storage, and transport of infectious material.
* Access restriction to trained personnel only.
* Incident reporting and investigation procedures.
* Regular biosafety training and drills.

### **4.5. Inactivation Protocols**

Before moving material to lower-containment areas, validated inactivation methods must be employed:

* Chemical inactivation (e.g., guanidinium isothiocyanate for nucleic acid extraction)
* Heat inactivation (validated protocols)
* Fixation for histopathology

Failure to properly inactivate samples has resulted in inadvertent exposures (Spengler et al., 2016).

## 5. Laboratory Accident Case Studies and Lessons Learned

### **5.1. South Africa (1969) – Needlestick**

A laboratory worker contracted CCHF after a needlestick while handling infected blood. Despite supportive care, the worker died. This incident highlighted the extreme risk of percutaneous exposure and led to stricter sharps management protocols (Gear et al., 1975).

### **5.2. Pakistan (1976) – Broken Ampoule**

A fatal infection occurred after a glass ampoule containing CCHFV broke, and the worker was exposed via cuts. The case emphasized the importance of safe sample handling, proper containment, and emergency response plans (Burney et al., 1980).

### **5.3. Iran (2000s) – Diagnostic Laboratory Exposure**

Several diagnostic laboratory workers contracted CCHF after handling blood from undiagnosed patients without adequate PPE or BSCs. These cases led to improved triage and risk assessment for samples from febrile patients with hemorrhagic symptoms (Mardani & Keshtkar-Jahromi, 2007).

### **5.4. Bulgaria (1974) – Processing Patient Blood**

A technician became infected while processing blood from a CCHF patient, likely due to a lack of gloves and eye protection. The incident underscored the need for universal precautions and PPE, even in resource-limited settings (Kovács et al., 1980).

## 6. Risk Mitigation Strategies

### **6.1. Early Recognition and Triage**

* Specimens from patients with unexplained fever and hemorrhagic symptoms should be treated as potentially high-risk until CCHFV is ruled out.
* Communication between clinicians and laboratory personnel is essential.

### **6.2. Minimizing Manipulation of Infectious Material**

* Use molecular or serological assays that require minimal sample handling.
* Inactivate samples at the point of collection when feasible.

### **6.3. Incident Response and Post-Exposure Prophylaxis**

* Immediate first aid (e.g., wound washing, eye irrigation)
* Medical evaluation and monitoring
* Consideration of ribavirin prophylaxis (though evidence is limited and controversial) (Ergönül, 2006)
* Reporting and documentation of the incident
* Root-cause analysis and corrective action

### **6.4. Vaccination**

No widely available vaccine exists for laboratory workers. An inactivated vaccine is used in Bulgaria and Russia but is not globally licensed or proven for post-exposure prophylaxis (Spengler et al., 2016).

## 7. Biosafety in Diagnostic and Research Laboratories

### **7.1. Diagnostic Laboratories**

* Use of BSL-2 or BSL-3 containment for routine serology or PCR if validated inactivation is confirmed.
* Strict adherence to universal precautions.
* Training for staff on recognition and handling of high-risk samples.

### **7.2. Research Laboratories**

* All work with live CCHFV or infected animals must be performed in BSL-4 facilities.
* Regular biosafety audits and certification of containment equipment.
* Simulation of emergency procedures (e.g., spills, exposure).

### **8.1. Expanding Endemic Areas**

As CCHFV spreads to new geographic regions, laboratories in previously non-endemic countries may encounter the virus for the first time, increasing risk due to unfamiliarity and lack of experience (Spengler et al., 2019).
