# History

## Introduction

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is recognized as the most important tick-borne viral disease affecting humans, with a wide geographic range spanning Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. The causative agent, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), belongs to the genus *Orthonairovirus* (family *Nairoviridae* ). The journey to understanding CCHFV highlights the convergence of discoveries from different continents and eras, illustrating the role of international collaboration in infectious disease research.

## The first outbreaks in Crimea

CCHF emerged into the scientific literature in 1944, during World War II, when Soviet military personnel and local agricultural workers in Crimea experienced sudden, severe illness marked by high fever, muscle pain, and widespread bleeding. The mortality rate was alarming, leading to significant concern among public health officials. Dr. Mikhail P. Chumakov spearheaded the investigation, quickly associating the illness with exposure to *Hyalomma* ticks in the fields. Through inoculation experiments in laboratory animals, the team confirmed a viral cause. The disease was initially termed "Crimean hemorrhagic fever," but the exact identity and classification of the virus remained unclear for decades.

Recent findings, including protein remnants in archaeological samples from Iron Age Germany, suggest CCHFV might have been present in Europe much earlier than previously appreciated.

## Independent discovery in Africa

Decades prior, physicians in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo reported similar hemorrhagic illnesses, but the pathogen’s identity remained undetermined. In 1956, Belgian scientists isolated a virus from a patient presenting hemorrhagic fever in the Congo, naming it "Congo virus." Patients in both regions developed sudden fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, and bleeding, with a consistent link to tick bites, particularly from the *Hyalomma* genus.

## Linking the Crimean and Congo Viruses

For several years, the Crimea and Congo viruses were considered separate. Serological investigations in the late 1960s provided the breakthrough: serum from patients in either outbreak neutralized both virus strains, revealing them to be antigenically identical. The new unified name—Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV)—was now recognized as a single, globally relevant threat.

## Vectors and reservoirs identified

Over the following decades, research established a tick-vertebrate-tick transmission cycle, confirming *Hyalomma* ticks as both **vector** and **reservoir**. CCHFV infects a broad spectrum of wild and domestic mammals, which usually remain asymptomatic but sustain viral amplification in nature. This clarified why CCHFV poses such a persistent risk to those with occupational or recreational exposure to ticks or livestock. Examples include soldiers, farmers, shepherds, butchers, and veterinarians.

## Expansion of knowledge and early characterization

By the 1970s, CCHF was recognized as a significant emerging public health threat across continents, including Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Advances in serological assays enabled broader surveillance, mapping the virus’s spread and guiding preventive measures. Genetic studies classified CCHFV as a bunyavirus with a segmented RNA genome, distinguishing it from other hemorrhagic viruses like Ebola or Lassa.

Today, CCHF is monitored globally, and its presence in new geographical regions, including potential incursions into western Europe, is watched closely as climate change alters tick distribution.

## Conclusion

The early discovery of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus is a fascinating example of parallel investigations converging to reveal the global significance of an emerging pathogen. From the initial outbreak in Crimea during World War II, through the isolation of a similar virus in Africa, to the eventual recognition of their identity, the story of CCHFV is a testament to the importance of international collaboration and vigilance in infectious disease research. Today, CCHF remains a major public health concern, particularly in regions where human-tick contact is common.

# Pathology in Humans Caused by Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (CCHFV)

## Introduction

Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is endemic in Africa, the Middle East, parts of Europe, and Asia, where sporadic outbreaks are marked by high fatality rates that can approach 40% among hospitilized patients. The virus remains a concern not only due to its potential to cause nosocomial outbreaks but also because of the historical classification as a select (formerly BSL-4) agent, underscoring its notoriety for laboratory and bioterror threat. With advances in biosafety protocols, the terminology of biosafety levels has evolved, but the stringent handling requirements remain unchanged.

## Incubation Period and Early Pathogenesis

Upon entering the body, CCHFV targets cells such as endothelial cells lining blood vessels, hepatocytes in the liver, mononuclear phagocytes, and various other parenchymal cells. This extensive cellular tropism is responsible for the virus’s rapid dissemination and the involvement of multiple organ systems.After entry ti a human, CCHFV targets endothelial cells, hepatocytes, mononuclear phagocytes, and other cell types, leading to widespread dissemination and multi-organ involvement.

The incubation period for CCHF depends on the route of exposure, typically lasting one to three days after a tick bite, with a maximum of nine days. When the exposure is through direct contact with infectious animal or human tissue, the incubation can be a bit longer, up to thirteen days. Initially, the virus replicates locally, before entering the bloodstream resulting in primary viremia. This leads to systemic dissemination to organs such as the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes.

## Viral Tropism and Cellular Targets

CCHFV demonstrates broad cellular tropism, infecting cells that are central to both immune response and organ function. Infection of **endothelial cells** undermines the vascular barrier, increasing permeability and paving the way for hemorrhagic manifestations. **Monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells**, crucial for orchestrating immune defense, become dysfunctional, leading to immune dysregulation. **Hepatic infection** results in liver injury, while **renal and gastrointestinal tissues** may also be affected.

## Clinical Stages

CCHF in humans follows a characteristic trajectory, defined by four clinical stages.CCHF generally progresses through four clinical phases:

1. Asymptomatic incubation phase.
2. Pre-hemorrhagic (or prodromal) phase, characterized by the abrupt onset of symptoms such as high fever, severe muscle aches (often in the back and legs), intense headaches, and signs of gastrointestinal disturbance. Mood changes, irritability, confusion, and a sore throat may also be present. These symptoms, however, are non-specific, often complicating early diagnosis unless a recent risky exposure is recognized.
3. Hemorrhagic phase, defined by diffuse bleeding—visible as petechial rash, larger bruises, and frank bleeding from mucosal surfaces. Blood may be found in vomitus, stool, urine, or from sites of venipuncture and medical intervention. At this stage, disseminated intravascular coagulation, multiorgan dysfunction, and shock can rapidly ensue.
4. The convalescent phase, if the patient survives the previous phase, can last up to one year.  This phase is often marked by prolonged weakness, hair loss, and even persistent neurological and psychiatric symptoms.

## Pathophysiological Mechanisms

The virus has the ability to devastate the vascular system. Endothelial cells are directly infected and damaged, breaking down the vascular barrier and causing leakage of fluidis and cells into tissues. Simultaneously, a cytokine storm is unleashed overwhelming the immune activation with a massive wave of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This intensifies vascular damage, encourages apoptosis, and activates clotting pathways that get rapidly depleted, manifesting as coagulopathy and widespread hemorrhage.

Animal studies reveal a strong correlation between genetic background, the degree of viral replication, and organ damage in the liver and spleen, highlighting the importance of host genetic factors in determining disease outcome.

## Organ-Specific Pathology

[INSERT IMAGE OF HUMAN BODY]

* Liver
  + The liver is a major target organ. Clinical and pathological findings include:
  + Hepatomegaly and liver tenderness
  + Elevation of liver enzymes
  + Histopathology
  + Jaundice
* Spleen and Lymphoid Tissue
  + Splenomegaly
* Kidneys
  + Acute tubular necrosis and interstitial nephritis may be seen.
  + Hematuria
  + Oliguria or anuria due to hypovolemia, shock, or direct renal injury.

## Long-Term Sequelae

For those who recover, convalescence can be lengthy. Survivors may deal with complications like persistent low blood pressure, irregular heart rhythms, nerve inflammation, breathing problems, dryness of the mouth, sensory deficits, hair loss, and varying degrees of memory impairment.

## Fatal vs. Non-Fatal Disease

A key determinant of outcome in CCHF is the viral load: fatal cases are typically associated with titers exceeding one billion (10^9) genome copies per milliliter of plasma, levels that can be over a thousand times higher than in survivors. Laboratory signs up to five days after symptom onset —such as severe thrombocytopenia, extremely elevated liver enzymes, and a marked increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines— strongly predict mortality. Clinical features like vomiting blood, blood in stool, strong drowsiness, and the inability to mount a timely antibody response are also signals of a possible fatal course.

## Laboratory Findings

CCHF shares many pathological features with other viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) such as Ebola, Marburg, and Lassa fever. All are characterized by endothelial damage, a dysregulated cytokine and immune response, disruption to the clotting system, and multi-organ injury. The hallmark laboratory finding in CCHF is a profound drop in platelet count (thrombocytopenia), often joined by leukopenia and elevated liver enzymes such as AST and ALT.

Key laboratory abnormalities reflecting pathology include:

* Thrombocytopenia
* Leukopenia → leukocytosis in severe cases
* Elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT, LDH)
* Elevated creatinine and urea (renal involvement)
* Prolonged PT, aPTT, elevated D-dimer, low fibrinogen (DIC)
* Proteinuria and hematuria
* High viral load in blood and tissues

CCHF RNA can be detected via RT-PCR, and viral loads typically peak during the first week of illness. Serum and whole blood being considered the gold standard. Viral RNA detection is also possible in peripheral samples such as saliva, urine, nasal, conjunctival, rectal, and vaginal swabs, especially in severe cases.

# Biology

## Virology and Transmission

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a master of adaptation. As an enveloped, negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus with three genome segments (S, M, L), it employs a clever strategy: different segments separately code for the nucleoprotein, glycoproteins, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, allowing for rapid genetic shifts and survival in diverse environments, such as different hosts. The virus relies on Hyalomma ticks as both vectors and reservoirs. Humans typically become infected via tick bites, through crushing ticks, or contact with blood or tissues from infected animals or people. In healthcare, the threat is heightened by documented nosocomial outbreaks, underscoring CCHFV’s capability for person-to-person spread if precautions lapse.

CCHFV is an enveloped negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the Orthonairovirus genus in the Nairoviridae family of the Bunyavirales order (Fig. 1a). In addition to CCHFV, the Nairoviridae family consists of arthropod-borne viruses such as Nairobi sheep disease virus, Dugbe virus and Hazara virus (HAZV), although these viruses seem to cause little-to-no disease in humans. As in other bunyaviruses, the tri-segmented viral genome is coated with the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and bound by the L protein (Fig. 1a). The viral proteins are encoded by three genomic segments (Fig. 1b), and relative to other members of the order that can cause human disease, CCHFV has a more complex

genomic organization (discussed below). On entry, these proteins produce positive-sense viral RNA using the genomic negative-sense viral RNA as a template to initiate viral protein production and replication (Fig. 1c). The viral glycoproteins Gn and Gc are found on the virion surface and are responsible for receptor binding and viral entry (Fig. 1a).

## Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus Biology

## Taxonomy and Classification

The genus to where CCHFV belongs to comprises several species, but CCHFV is the most significant human pathogen. The family Nairoviridae contains viruses primarily transmitted by ticks and is distinct from other bunyaviruses transmitted by mosquitoes or rodents.

**Order**: Bunyavirales

**Family**: Nairoviridae

**Genus**: Orthonairovirus

**Species**: Orthonairovirus haemorrhagiae (Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus)

## Virion Structure and Morphology

CCHFV virions are spherical to pleomorphic, enveloped particles with a diameter of 80–120 nm. The viral envelope is derived from the host cell membrane and is studded with two types of glycoprotein spikes: Gn and Gc.

CCHFV particles are generally spherical (80–120 nm in diameter) with a flexible envelope derived from the host cell. Embedded in this envelope are two types of spiky glycoproteins (Gn and Gc), which give the virus both its ability to latch onto new cells and to dodge immune defenses. The interior contains the tripartite genome as ribonucleoprotein complexes, expertly packaged for rapid replication

## Genome Organization

The CCHFV genome is neatly divided into three segments, each segment with a specific job.

**Small (S) Segment**: Encodes the nucleoprotein (N).

**Medium (M) Segment**: Encodes the glycoprotein precursor (GPC), which is processed into Gn, Gc, and several nonstructural proteins.

**Large (L) Segment**: Encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L protein).


| **Segment** | **Size (kb)** | **Key Protein(s)**     | **Role**                       |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| S           | ~1.7          | Nucleoprotein (N)      | RNA encapsidation, replication |
| M           | ~5.4          | Glycoproteins (Gn, Gc) | Host entry, immune evasion     |
| L           | ~12.1         | Polymerase (L)         | RNA synthesis                  |

Each segment is flanked by conserved noncoding regions, crucial for replication and genome packing.

## Replication Cycle

CCHFV replicates entirely within the cytoplasm, following a rapid and efficient cycle:

1. **Entry**: Gn and Gc glycoproteins lock onto receptors on host cells, then the virus enters via clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
2. **Fusion & Release**: Acidic conditions in the cell trigger Gc-glycoproteins, merging viral and endosomal membranes and releasing viral complexes into the cytoplasm.
3. **Transcription/Translation**: The L polymerase “steals” caps from host mRNA (cap-snatching) for viral mRNA synthesis; proteins are made on host ribosomes.
4. **Genome Replication**: Complementary full-length RNA is created to serve as templates for more genomic RNA.
5. **Assembly and Release:** Viral proteins and genomes are assembled at the Golgi or plasma membrane; new virus particles exit the cell by budding, armed for further infection.

## Genetic Diversity and Evolution

CCHFV stands out as one of the most variable tick-borne viruses—strains can differ by up to 20% in their genetic code. This diversity results from:

* **The virus's segmented genome**, promoting exchanges and rearrangements during co-infection by different strains within a host.
* A **naturallly high mutation rate** due to lack of proofreading during replication.
* The evolution in a **wide geographic range** with circulation in many tick and animal hosts.

Phylogenetic studies show major lineages in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. This diversity of the virus contributes to the emergence of novel strains with unpredictedable virulence and epidemiology.

## Ecology, Hosts, and Transmission Dynamics

## Tick Vectors

Hyalomma ticks are both the long-term home and the main vector for CCHFV. They can carry the virus throughout their multi-stage life cycle—larva, nymph, adult—and even transmit it to their offspring. Once infected, ticks remain carriers for life and transmit the virus to animals and sometimes humans.

## Vertebrate Hosts

A wide array of animals —cattle, sheep, goats, camels, horses, hares, hedgehogs, rodents— can host CCHFV. Most animals show no symptoms but get short-lived viremia, providing a bridge for ticks to pick up and spread the virus. Some ground-feeding birds may carry infected ticks but generally do not get sick.

## Human Infection

Humans are accidental hosts, typically becoming infected by:

* **Tick bites**, the primary pathway.
* **Contact with blood/tissues**. Farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers are at heightened risk when handling livestock, particularly during slaughter or birthing, as the virus can spread through small cuts or abrasions.
* **Nosocomial (hospital-acquired) or household transmission**, via blood or body fluids.
* **Laboratory exposure**. Rare, but laboratory workers can become infected while handling patient samples or cultures if strict biosafety practices are not observed.

Humans, however, generally do not develop high enough viremia to infect new ticks, so human-to-tick transmission is usually insignificant in the spread of the virus.

## Geographic Distribution

The virus is endemic in over 30 countries spanning Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Asia. Its geographic footprint closely shadows the range of its preferred tick hosts, particularly *Hyalomma* ticks. This distribution is not random; instead, it is shaped by environmental and human-made factors:

* **Ecological factors**: Regions with climates that favor dense vegetation and sustain livestock provide ideal habitats for ticks, increasing the risk of CCHFV transmission.
* **Animal trade and migration**: The movement of animals across borders, whether for trade or seasonal migration, can carry infected ticks into new regions.
* **Human activities**: Agricultural practices, animal husbandry, and even simple travel to endemic areas enhance opportunities for people and animals to encounter infected ticks.

Countries such as Turkey, Iran, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, South Africa, and those in the Balkans have reported important outbreaks. These occurrences tend to spike seasonally, usually during periods when tick activity reaches its peak, often coinciding with warmer weather or heightened agricultural activity .

# Prevention & Control

Protecting against Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) calls for a multi-sector, collaborative defense, including farms, clinics, households, and public health systems. Although no licensed vaccine is currently available for humans and animals, a variety of proactive strategies can sharply reduce the risk of infection and control the spread of the virus.

## Personal Protective Measures

### Tick bite prevention

On the front lines, farm workers and rural residents should wear long sleeves, pants, and closed footwear when working in tick-infested fields or with livestock. Simple clothing choices serve as the first line of defense against tick bites.

### Workplace safety

In healthcare and slaughterhouse settings, personal protective equipment (PPE) are barriers that limit exposure to infected blood or body fluids and reduce the chances of accidental transmission. Examples of PPE include laboratory gowns, gloves, face shields, and masks.

### **Training and protocols**

Abattoir and healthcare staff should be trained in proper animal handling, safe butchering techniques, and infection prevention protocols to reinforce PPE effectiveness.


## Controlling Ticks and Livestock

### Vector control

Managing the tick population is critical. This may involve applying acaricides to livestock and in pastures, regular tick checks, and keeping farm animals treated and monitored for infestations.

### **Quarantine and inspection:**

Animals moving from endemic areas should undergo careful inspection and, if necessary, quarantine.

### Animal vaccination development

Despite the promising vaccine trials, there are currently ****no licensed CCHFV vaccines**** for widespread use in animals. Efforts to vaccinate livestock against CCHFV face a significant challenge: since infected animals rarely show obvious signs of illness, farmers and agricultural businesses often lack an economic reason to invest in vaccination solely to protect human health.

## Education and Community Awareness

### Informing at-risk groups

At-risk communities can be taught to avoid risky exposures, recognize symptoms early, and take precautions when working with animals or spending time outdoors. The more people know about tick risks and the importance of early detection, the better they can protect themselves and limit the virus’s spread.

# Laboratory Diagnosis

Diagnosis relies on:

Preferred clinical specimen is whole blood or serum/plasma.

**Detection of viral RNA**: Real-time RT-PCR is the gold standard during the acute phase.

**Serology**: ELISA for IgM and IgG antibodies in later stages.

**Virus isolation**: Requires risk assessment to determine capability of facilities, and appropriate biocontainment.

**Antigen detection**: Mainly targeting CCHFV nucleoprotein (NP).


# Epidemiology of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus in Animals and Humans

## 3. Geographic Distribution and Expansion

### **3.1 Endemic and Epidemic Regions**

CCHFV is distributed across:

* **Africa:** Widespread, including South Africa, Sudan, Uganda, Nigeria, and others.
* **Asia:** Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, India, China (Xinjiang), and others.
* **Middle East:** Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Oman, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and others.
* **Eastern and Southern Europe:** Russia, Bulgaria, Albania, Greece, Kosovo, Bosnia, Spain, and others (Papa et al., 2015; Spengler et al., 2019).

The distribution of CCHFV closely matches that of Hyalomma ticks.

### **3.2 Factors Driving Geographic Expansion**

* **Climate change:** Warmer temperatures and altered rainfall patterns expand tick habitats into new regions (Estrada-Peña et al., 2012).
* **Animal movement and trade:** Movement of livestock and wildlife, as well as migratory birds carrying infected ticks, facilitate spread (Spengler et al., 2016).
* **Land use and agricultural practices:** Increased livestock rearing and land fragmentation create suitable environments for ticks and their hosts.

### **3.3 Emergence in New Regions**

Recent reports of CCHFV in Spain and the Balkans highlight the potential for further expansion into Western Europe (Negredo et al., 2017; Papa et al., 2015).

## 4. Epidemiology in Animals

### **4.1 Seroprevalence Studies**

Serological surveys indicate widespread exposure in livestock:

* **Cattle and sheep**: Seroprevalence can exceed 50% in endemic areas.
* **Camels and goats**: Also exhibit high seroprevalence, especially in arid regions (Spengler et al., 2016).
* **Wild mammals**: Lower but significant rates of seropositivity.

Seroprevalence increases with animal age, reflecting cumulative tick exposure (Whitehouse, 2004).

### **4.2 Animal Disease**

CCHFV infection in animals is almost always asymptomatic. Viremia is short-lived (3–7 days), but sufficient to infect feeding ticks. No significant economic losses are directly attributed to CCHFV in livestock, but the presence of the virus restricts animal trade (Whitehouse, 2004).

### **4.3 Seasonality**

Tick activity (and thus virus transmission) is highly seasonal, peaking during warm months. This seasonality is mirrored in seroprevalence and human case data (Bente et al., 2013).

## 5. Epidemiology in Humans

### **5.1 Incidence and Outbreaks**

#### **5.1.1 Endemicity and Outbreaks**

Human cases occur sporadically, as isolated cases or outbreaks, often linked to agricultural or animal-handling activities. Notable outbreaks:

* **Turkey:** Since 2002, thousands of cases with case fatality rates (CFR) of 5–10% (Ergönül, 2006).
* **Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Russia, and Balkans:** Recurrent outbreaks with varying CFRs.

#### **5.1.2 Case Fatality Rate**

CFR varies by region, outbreak, and healthcare availability, ranging from 5% to over 30% (Papa et al., 2015; Ergönül, 2006).

### **5.2 Risk Factors for Human Infection**

* **Occupation:** Farmers, butchers, veterinarians, abattoir workers, healthcare workers (nosocomial exposure).
* **Exposure:** Tick bites, handling of livestock, slaughtering, and contact with animal tissues or blood.
* **Gender and age:** More common in males and adults, reflecting occupational exposure patterns.
* **Seasonality:** Most cases occur during peak tick activity (spring and summer) (Ergönül, 2006; Spengler et al., 2016).

### **5.3 Modes of Transmission**

#### **5.3.1 Tick Bites**

Most primary human cases result from tick bites during outdoor activities.

#### **5.3.2 Contact with Infected Animals**

Handling or slaughtering viremic animals is a significant risk, especially in rural settings and during religious festivals involving animal sacrifice (Spengler et al., 2016).

#### **5.3.3 Nosocomial Transmission**

Secondary cases occur through contact with blood, secretions, or tissues of infected patients, particularly in healthcare settings lacking adequate infection control (Ergönül, 2006; Mardani & Keshtkar-Jahromi, 2007).

#### **5.3.4 Person-to-Person Transmission**

Direct human-to-human transmission (not vector-borne) is rare but can occur through exposure to infectious blood or body fluids.

## 6. Outbreak Dynamics and Patterns

### **6.1 Zoonotic Spillover**

Most outbreaks result from zoonotic spillover events, often linked to:

* **Increased tick activity**
* **Animal movements**
* **Slaughtering of livestock**

### **6.2 Clustered and Nosocomial Outbreaks**

Outbreaks may be:

* **Clustered in families or communities** due to shared exposure.
* **Nosocomial** due to inadequate infection control in hospitals (Mardani & Keshtkar-Jahromi, 2007).

### **6.3 Surveillance Challenges**

Underreporting is common due to:

* **Non-specific early symptoms**
* **Lack of diagnostic facilities in rural areas**
* **Stigmatization and fear of isolation**

## 7. Molecular Epidemiology

### **7.1 Genetic Diversity**

CCHFV exhibits high genetic diversity, with multiple genotypes circulating in different regions (Deyde et al., 2006). Phylogenetic analyses reveal several distinct lineages associated with Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East.

### **7.2 Reassortment and Evolution**

The segmented genome allows for genetic reassortment, contributing to the emergence of novel strains with potential changes in virulence, transmissibility, and antigenicity (Bente et al., 2013).

## 8. Surveillance and Control

### **8.1 Animal Surveillance**

* **Serosurveys in livestock**: Useful for mapping endemicity and risk.
* **Tick surveillance**: Identification of infected tick populations and mapping their distribution.

### **8.2 Human Surveillance**

* **Case reporting**: Notifiable disease in many endemic countries.
* **Laboratory diagnostics**: Real-time RT-PCR and serology (ELISA, IFA) are mainstays (Ergönül, 2006).

### **8.3 Prevention and Control Strategies**

* **Personal protection**: Avoidance of tick bites, use of repellents, and protective clothing.
* **Tick control on animals**: Regular use of acaricides.
* **Safe animal handling**: Protective measures during slaughtering and veterinary procedures.
* **Hospital infection control**: Strict barrier nursing, isolation of suspected cases, and safe handling of blood and tissues.
* **Public awareness**: Education campaigns in rural and at-risk populations.

### **8.4 Vaccination**

No widely licensed vaccine exists for humans or animals, although an inactivated vaccine is used on a limited basis in Bulgaria and Russia (Ergönül, 2006; Spengler et al., 2016).

## 9. Impact of Climate and Environmental Changes

### **9.1 Climate Change**

Warming temperatures and altered precipitation patterns are expanding the habitats of Hyalomma ticks, increasing the risk of CCHFV emergence in new regions (Estrada-Peña et al., 2012).

### **9.2 Land Use and Human Activity**

Deforestation, agricultural expansion, and changes in animal husbandry practices influence tick and host populations, affecting virus transmission dynamics.

## 10. One Health Perspective

The epidemiology of CCHFV exemplifies the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health:

* **Animals and ticks** serve as reservoirs and amplifiers.
* **Humans** are exposed through environmental, occupational, and behavioral factors.
* **Integrated surveillance** across veterinary and human health sectors is critical for early detection and response (Spengler et al., 2016).

## Conclusion

The epidemiology of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus is characterized by a complex tick-animal-human transmission cycle, broad geographic distribution, and the potential for explosive outbreaks in humans. Ticks, particularly Hyalomma spp., are both vectors and reservoirs, maintaining the virus in nature through vertical and horizontal transmission. Domestic and wild animals serve as amplifying hosts, while humans are incidental hosts who may acquire infection through tick bites or contact with infected animals or humans.

The risk of CCHFV emergence and spread is influenced by climate change, animal and human movement, land use changes, and gaps in surveillance and control. Addressing these challenges requires a One Health approach, integrating veterinary, human, and environmental health efforts to monitor, prevent, and control this important zoonotic threat.

# Risks in Laboratory

## 1. CCHFV as a Laboratory Hazard

### **1.1. Virological Properties and Risk Profile**

CCHFV is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a tripartite genome. The virus is highly infectious, with low minimum infectious doses in animal models and humans. Human-to-human transmission is well-documented, particularly in healthcare and laboratory settings, and occurs via exposure to blood, tissues, or other body fluids (Ergönül, 2006; Bente et al., 2013).

Key features that heighten laboratory risk include:

* High viral titers in patient blood and tissues during the acute phase
* Stability in blood and tissues at room temperature
* Aerosol transmissibility in animal models and potential for laboratory-generated aerosols
* Lack of effective, widely available vaccines or specific antiviral therapy
* High case fatality rates (10–40%) in humans (Whitehouse, 2004; Spengler et al., 2016)

### **1.2. Biosafety Level and Laboratory Work**

Given its high infectivity and severe disease potential, CCHFV is classified as a Risk Group 4 (RG4) agent and requires Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) containment for in vitro virus propagation, manipulation of infectious material, and animal experiments (CDC, 2020; WHO, 2004). Diagnostic work with inactivated material or clinical specimens can be performed at lower biosafety levels, provided validated inactivation methods are used.

## 2. Historical Laboratory-Acquired Infections and Accidents

### **2.1. Documented Laboratory-Acquired Infections**

Since its identification, several cases of laboratory-acquired CCHFV infection have been reported. These have occurred in various settings, including research laboratories, diagnostic facilities, and animal research units.

#### **2.1.1. Early Reports**

* **Soviet Union (1944–1950s):** The earliest recognized CCHF cases in Crimea included laboratory and medical personnel infected while handling patient samples or working with the virus (Chumakov, 1965).
* **South Africa (1969):** A laboratory worker developed CCHF following a needlestick injury while handling infectious material (Gear et al., 1975).
* **Bulgaria (1974):** A laboratory technician became infected while processing blood from a CCHF patient, likely due to inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and handling errors (Kovács et al., 1980).

#### **2.1.2. Later Incidents**

* **Pakistan (1976):** A fatal LAI occurred after a laboratory accident involving a broken ampoule containing CCHFV (Burney et al., 1980).
* **Iran (2000s):** Multiple laboratory-acquired infections have been reported in recent decades, often linked to improper handling of blood or tissues or accidental exposure during diagnostic procedures (Mardani & Keshtkar-Jahromi, 2007).

These cases, though not frequent, underscore the persistent risk of LAIs with CCHFV and the potential for fatal outcomes.

### **2.2. Routes of Laboratory Exposure**

Analysis of LAIs reveals several common routes of exposure:

1. **Percutaneous injuries** (needlestick, broken glass, scalpel cuts)
2. **Mucocutaneous exposure** (splash to eyes, nose, or mouth)
3. **Aerosol generation** (centrifugation, pipetting, sonication, necropsy)
4. **Contact with contaminated surfaces or equipment**
5. **Improper use or failure of PPE**
6. **Lack of or failure in biosafety cabinet (BSC) procedures** (CDC, 2020; WHO, 2004)

## 3. Risk Assessment for Laboratory Work with CCHFV

### **3.1. Types of Laboratory Activities and Associated Risks**


| **Activity**                              | **Risk Level**     | **Containment Requirement** |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Virus isolation, propagation, titration   | High               | BSL-4                       |
| Animal infection studies                  | High               | BSL-4                       |
| Handling acutely infected animal tissues  | High               | BSL-4                       |
| RT-PCR or serology on inactivated samples | Low (if effective) | BSL-2/BSL-3 (with caveats)  |
| Handling patient samples (unfixed)        | High               | BSL-3+ or BSL-4             |
| Work with fixed/inactivated material      | Low (if validated) | BSL-2                       |

**Note:** All work with live virus or potentially infectious material should be treated with the utmost caution and, where possible, performed in BSL-4 containment.

### **3.2. Diagnostic Laboratory Risks**

Most LAIs have occurred in research settings, but diagnostic laboratories also face risks when handling blood, serum, or tissues from suspect patients. The infectious dose for CCHFV is low, and viremia in acute-phase blood can be very high (Ergönül, 2006; Spengler et al., 2016).

## 4. Biosafety and Biosecurity Measures

### **4.1. Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) Containment**

#### **4.1.1. Facility Features**

* **Maximum containment laboratories** with HEPA-filtered ventilation, negative air pressure, and restricted access
* **Class III biosafety cabinets** or full-body, air-supplied positive-pressure suits
* **Decontamination systems** (autoclaves, chemical showers)
* **Rigorous waste disposal and effluent treatment systems** (CDC, 2020; WHO, 2004)

#### **4.1.2. Work Practices**

* All manipulations of live virus or infectious samples are performed within a certified BSC or Class III cabinet.
* Double-gloving and use of impermeable gowns or suits.
* Strict protocols for entry, exit, and decontamination.
* Comprehensive training and competency assessment for personnel.

### **4.2. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**

PPE for CCHFV work includes:

* Full-body suits (positive-pressure if available)
* Double gloves
* Eye and face protection (goggles, face shields)
* Respiratory protection (PAPR or N95/FFP3 masks)
* Waterproof aprons or gowns

Failure to use PPE correctly or breaches in PPE are leading causes of LAIs (CDC, 2020).

### **4.3. Engineering Controls**

* **Biosafety cabinets:** All manipulations of infectious material must be performed in a certified BSC (Class II or III).
* **Centrifugation:** Use of sealed rotors or safety cups; opening only in BSCs.
* **Sharps management:** Minimization of sharps use; immediate disposal in puncture-resistant containers.

### **4.4. Administrative Controls and Training**

* Strict protocols for handling, storage, and transport of infectious material.
* Access restriction to trained personnel only.
* Incident reporting and investigation procedures.
* Regular biosafety training and drills.

### **4.5. Inactivation Protocols**

Before moving material to lower-containment areas, validated inactivation methods must be employed:

* Chemical inactivation (e.g., guanidinium isothiocyanate for nucleic acid extraction)
* Heat inactivation (validated protocols)
* Fixation for histopathology

Failure to properly inactivate samples has resulted in inadvertent exposures (Spengler et al., 2016).

## 5. Laboratory Accident Case Studies and Lessons Learned

### **5.1. South Africa (1969) – Needlestick**

A laboratory worker contracted CCHF after a needlestick while handling infected blood. Despite supportive care, the worker died. This incident highlighted the extreme risk of percutaneous exposure and led to stricter sharps management protocols (Gear et al., 1975).

### **5.2. Pakistan (1976) – Broken Ampoule**

A fatal infection occurred after a glass ampoule containing CCHFV broke, and the worker was exposed via cuts. The case emphasized the importance of safe sample handling, proper containment, and emergency response plans (Burney et al., 1980).

### **5.3. Iran (2000s) – Diagnostic Laboratory Exposure**

Several diagnostic laboratory workers contracted CCHF after handling blood from undiagnosed patients without adequate PPE or BSCs. These cases led to improved triage and risk assessment for samples from febrile patients with hemorrhagic symptoms (Mardani & Keshtkar-Jahromi, 2007).

### **5.4. Bulgaria (1974) – Processing Patient Blood**

A technician became infected while processing blood from a CCHF patient, likely due to a lack of gloves and eye protection. The incident underscored the need for universal precautions and PPE, even in resource-limited settings (Kovács et al., 1980).

## 6. Risk Mitigation Strategies

### **6.1. Early Recognition and Triage**

* Specimens from patients with unexplained fever and hemorrhagic symptoms should be treated as potentially high-risk until CCHFV is ruled out.
* Communication between clinicians and laboratory personnel is essential.

### **6.2. Minimizing Manipulation of Infectious Material**

* Use molecular or serological assays that require minimal sample handling.
* Inactivate samples at the point of collection when feasible.

### **6.3. Incident Response and Post-Exposure Prophylaxis**

* Immediate first aid (e.g., wound washing, eye irrigation)
* Medical evaluation and monitoring
* Consideration of ribavirin prophylaxis (though evidence is limited and controversial) (Ergönül, 2006)
* Reporting and documentation of the incident
* Root-cause analysis and corrective action

### **6.4. Vaccination**

No widely available vaccine exists for laboratory workers. An inactivated vaccine is used in Bulgaria and Russia but is not globally licensed or proven for post-exposure prophylaxis (Spengler et al., 2016).

## 7. Biosafety in Diagnostic and Research Laboratories

### **7.1. Diagnostic Laboratories**

* Use of BSL-2 or BSL-3 containment for routine serology or PCR if validated inactivation is confirmed.
* Strict adherence to universal precautions.
* Training for staff on recognition and handling of high-risk samples.

### **7.2. Research Laboratories**

* All work with live CCHFV or infected animals must be performed in BSL-4 facilities.
* Regular biosafety audits and certification of containment equipment.
* Simulation of emergency procedures (e.g., spills, exposure).

### **8.1. Expanding Endemic Areas**

As CCHFV spreads to new geographic regions, laboratories in previously non-endemic countries may encounter the virus for the first time, increasing risk due to unfamiliarity and lack of experience (Spengler et al., 2019).
