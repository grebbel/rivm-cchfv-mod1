## Summary of Changes Completed

All tasks have been completed successfully:

1. **Title updated**: "Module 3: Principles of Real-time PCR" → "Module 1: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever"
2. **Subtitle updated**: "A comprehensive guide..." → "The Biology of the virus"
3. **Navigation chapters renamed**:
   - Introduction → History
   - PCR Principle → Pathology
   - Real-time PCR → Biology
   - SYBR Green → Epidemiology
   - TaqMan Probe → Prevention & Control
   - Reverse Transcriptase → Laboratory diagnosis
4. **Chapters removed**: Controls, Multiplex PCR, Troubleshooting
5. **Script.js updated**: Total chapters changed from 9 to 6

**Note**: The content sections for the renamed chapters (beyond History and Pathology) appear to be missing from the current index.html file. The file is truncated at 386 lines. You'll need to add the actual content for Biology, Epidemiology, Prevention & Control, and Laboratory diagnosis sections.
