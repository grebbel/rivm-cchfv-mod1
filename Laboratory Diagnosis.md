# Laboratory Diagnosis

Since initial symptoms—fever, headache, and general malaise—often mimic other diseases like malaria or leptospirosis, laboratory testing is required to distinguishing CCHF from other illnesses. This process relies on the coordinated use of both molecular and serological techniques, each selected based on the stage of disease presentation.

## Diagnostic Methods: Molecular vs. Serological

### Early Phase (Days 1–7): Detecting the Virus

**Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction** (RT-PCR) is the frontline tool, providing rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of viral RNA in blood, plasma, serum, urine, or tissue. RT-PCR is most effective in the first five days, before the patient's immune system responds with antibodies.

**Prognostic insights** can be provided with Quantitative RT-PCR. This allows measurement of viral load, which is closely linked to patient outcome. Higher viral loads (lower Ct values) indicate greater severity and a poorer prognosis.

Due to the virus’s wide genetic variability, protocols must be validated to detect all known lineages for reliable results.

### Later Phase (After Day 5–7): Detecting the Immune Response

**Serological Tests (ELISA, IFA)** identify specific IgM and IgG antibodies against the CCHFV. IgM emerges 5–7 days after infection, peaking at 2–3 weeks and fading by month four. IgG appears slightly later and can persist for several years, indicating past exposure. Acute infection is confirmed by IgM detection or a four-fold rise in IgG titers between paired samples. However, in severe or fatal cases, antibody responses may be absent or delayed; molecular tests remain essential for confirmation.

Supplementing biomarkers of CCHFV infection are low platelets, white cell counts, elevated liver enzymes, and increased inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α point to severe disease.

For post-mortem studies, **Immunohistochemistry** can be applied on tissue samples to locae viral antigens in cells. Next-Generation Sequencing enables the identification and evolution tacking of CCHFV strains for surveillance of the disease.
