# Module 11 — Skeleton copy of CCHF PCR course

This folder contains a skeleton copy of the CCHF PCR course layout so you can drop in module-specific content for Module 11.

Files added as placeholders:

- `index.html` — main module page (placeholder copy)
- `script.js` — JS for interactive elements (copied from module 3 as a starting point)
- `style.css` — styling (copied)
- `imsmanifest.xml` — SCORM manifest (copied)
- `scorm-wrapper.js` — SCORM helper (copied)
- `LICENSE` — license text
- `images/` — images folder with `README.md` and `icons/placeholder.txt`
- `issues/` — issues README placeholder

Next steps:
- Replace `index.html`/`script.js`/`style.css` with module-specific content.
- Add images into `images/` and update `imsmanifest.xml` if packaging.
- Keep `scorm-wrapper.js` if you need SCORM functionality.
