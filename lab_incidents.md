* Soviet Union (1944–1950s): The earliest recognized CCHF cases in Crimea included laboratory and medical personnel infected while handling patient samples or working with the virus (Chumakov, 1965).
* South Africa (1969): A laboratory worker developed CCHF following a needlestick injury while handling infectious material (Gear et al., 1975).
* Bulgaria (1974): A laboratory technician became infected while processing blood from a CCHF patient, likely due to inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and handling errors (Kovács et al., 1980).
* Pakistan (1976): A fatal LAI occurred after a laboratory accident involving a broken ampoule containing CCHFV (Burney et al., 1980).
* Iran (2000s): Multiple laboratory-acquired infections have been reported in recent decades, often linked to improper handling of blood or tissues or accidental exposure during diagnostic procedures (Mardani & Keshtkar-Jahromi, 2007).
